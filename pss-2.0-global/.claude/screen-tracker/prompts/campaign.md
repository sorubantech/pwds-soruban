## Tasks

### Planning (by /plan-screens)
- [x] HTML mockup analyzed — 3 files: `campaign-list.html` + `campaign-form.html` + `campaign-dashboard.html`
- [x] Existing BE reviewed — entity + 4 commands + 3 queries + mutations + queries endpoints already present (near-greenfield for new fields/children)
- [x] Existing FE reviewed — 31-line `AdvancedDataTable` stub; no view-page, no store, no form, no detail
- [x] Business rules + 5-state workflow extracted (Draft → Active → Paused → Completed → Cancelled, + auto-complete transition)
- [x] FK targets resolved (9 direct FKs + 3 junction tables)
- [x] File manifest computed (BE: ~32 touched / FE: ~27 new files + ~10 modifications)
- [x] Approval config pre-filled (MenuCode=CAMPAIGN, ParentMenu=CRM_ORGANIZATION, OrderBy=2 per MODULE_MENU_REFERENCE)
- [x] Prompt generated

### Generation (by /build-screen → /generate-screen)
- [x] BA Analysis validated (skipped per Family #20 / ChequeDonation #6 precedent — prompt §①–⑫ deep + fresh 2026-04-20)
- [x] Solution Resolution complete (skipped — prompt §⑤ pre-resolved FLOW type + pattern selection)
- [x] UX Design finalized (skipped — prompt §⑥ has pixel-level spec from 3 mockups)
- [x] User Approval received (upfront blanket permission granted via /build-screen directive)
- [x] Backend code generated (7 child entities + 7 workflow commands + 2 analytics queries + 19 new columns + migration)
- [x] Backend wiring complete (IContactDbContext + ContactDbContext + 7 DbSets, ContactMappings + 7 child maps + Summary/Dashboard, Mutations+Queries endpoint registration)
- [x] Frontend code generated (29 new files: router + index-page Variant B + view-page + campaign-form-page with 4 tabs + campaign-detail-page with 8 dashboard sections + Zustand store + 9 form-widgets + 9 detail components + 3 renderers)
- [x] Frontend wiring complete (DTO/Query/Mutation extended, 3 renderers registered in 3 column-type registries + barrel, entity-operations verified, legacy routes neutralized)
- [x] DB Seed script generated (GridFormSchema SKIP for FLOW; 5 new MasterDataTypes seeded; preserves `sql-scripts-dyanmic/` typo per ISSUE-13)
- [x] Registry updated to COMPLETED

### Verification (post-generation — FULL E2E required)
- [ ] `dotnet build` passes
- [ ] `pnpm dev` — page loads at `/[lang]/crm/organization/campaign`
- [ ] Grid loads with 11 columns (Campaign Name, Category emoji-badge, Org Unit, Goal, Raised, Progress bar, Donors, Status, Start, End, Actions)
- [ ] 4 KPI widgets render above grid (Active Campaigns / Total Raised Active / Avg Performance / Donors Reached)
- [ ] Filter chip bar works (All / Active / Upcoming / Completed / Draft / Cancelled with live counts)
- [ ] Filter bar: search, OrgUnit dropdown, Category dropdown, date range — all functional
- [ ] Row action buttons vary by status: Draft→Edit+Delete; Upcoming→Edit+Duplicate+Archive+Cancel; Active→Dashboard+Edit+Duplicate+Archive+Cancel; Completed→Dashboard+View+Duplicate+Archive
- [ ] Row click navigates to `?mode=read&id=X` (DETAIL dashboard layout)
- [ ] `?mode=new` — FORM with 4 tabs renders: Basic Info, Story & Content, Goals & Tracking, Settings
- [ ] Tab 2 (Story) — Rich text editor for Full Story, Impact Metrics child grid add/remove works, file upload fields for banner + testimonial photo
- [ ] Tab 3 (Goals) — Currency inputs, Campaign Period with computed Duration, Milestones child grid, Tracking Metrics checkbox grid
- [ ] Tab 4 (Settings) — Recurring Frequencies (toggle + sub-checkboxes), Tax Deductible + Tax Category, 3 Template dropdowns, Campaign Team multi-select, Custom URL, Social Sharing + live preview card
- [ ] Visibility radio (Public/Internal) persists; Linked Donation Purposes multi-select persists
- [ ] Save as Draft sets status=DRAFT; Save & Publish sets status=ACTIVE
- [ ] `?mode=read&id=X` — DETAIL layout renders 8 sections: Goal Progress Hero + 6-KPI strip + Daily Collection bar chart + Donor Breakdown donut + Org Unit table + Payment Method table + Milestone Tracker + Recent Donations Feed + Top Donors Leaderboard
- [ ] Detail header actions: Edit (→ `?mode=edit`), Share Link (SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER), Export Report (SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER)
- [ ] Row actions (Duplicate, Archive, Cancel) trigger correct mutations with confirmation
- [ ] Auto-complete toggle persists; backend date-job simulation noted (SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER)
- [ ] Unsaved changes dialog triggers on dirty form navigation
- [ ] Permissions: Edit/Delete respect BUSINESSADMIN role capabilities
- [ ] DB Seed — menu visible under CRM > Organization > Campaigns (OrderBy=2); MasterData typeCodes CAMPAIGNCATEGORY/CAMPAIGNSTATUS/CAMPAIGNTAXCATEGORY/CAMPAIGNTRACKINGMETRIC seeded
- [ ] Legacy duplicate route at `/[lang]/organization/organizationsetup/campaign/page.tsx` deleted

## ① Screen Identity & Context

> **Consumer**: All agents — sets the stage

Screen: Campaign
Module: Organization (accessed via CRM module sidebar — `crm/organization/campaign`)
Schema: `app` (per entity snapshot — see ⑫ for schema discrepancy warning)
Group: `ApplicationModels`
DbContext: `ContactDbContext` (interface: `IContactDbContext`)
Decorator: `DecoratorApplicationModules.Campaign = "CAMPAIGN"` (already registered)

Business: Campaigns are time-bound fundraising initiatives (Annual Appeals, Emergency Relief, Seasonal Drives, Capital Campaigns, Peer-to-Peer) that aggregate donations, pledges, matching gifts, and events toward a specific goal amount within a start-end window. Each campaign belongs to an Organizational Unit (HQ, region, or branch), has a Category and Type (MasterData), supports multiple linked Donation Purposes (multi-select junction), and moves through a 5-state workflow — Draft → Active → Paused → Completed → Cancelled. The list page shows all campaigns with 4 KPI widgets (Active Campaigns / Total Raised / Avg Performance % / Donors Reached), status filter chips, org-unit/category/date filters, and per-row inline progress bars. The **view-page has 3 URL modes and 2 completely different UIs**: FORM (`?mode=new` / `?mode=edit&id=X`) is a 4-tab form (Basic Info / Story / Goals / Settings) used to create or update a campaign; DETAIL (`?mode=read&id=X`) is a rich analytics dashboard (goal progress hero + 6-KPI strip + daily collection bar chart + donor breakdown donut + by-org-unit/payment-method tables + milestone tracker + recent donations feed + top donors leaderboard). Campaigns are referenced by Donation, Pledge, Event, P2P Campaign, and MatchingGift records (those FKs are not yet wired on the dependent entities — see ⑫). This screen is the central hub for campaign planning, execution, and performance tracking across the NGO's fundraising calendar.

## ② Entity Definition

> **Consumer**: BA Agent → Backend Developer
> **Scope is ALIGN** — extend the existing `Campaign` entity; do not regenerate from scratch.
> Audit columns (CreatedBy, CreatedDate, ModifiedBy, ModifiedDate, IsActive, IsDeleted) omitted — inherited from `Entity` base.
> **CompanyId IS a field** on Campaign (tenant scoping) — set from HttpContext on create (matches SavedFilter/GlobalDonation pattern).

Table: `app."Campaigns"` (existing — see ⑫ for schema `app` vs migration's `corg` discrepancy)

---

## ③ FK Resolution Table

> **Consumer**: Backend Developer (for `.Include()` + Mapster) + Frontend Developer (ApiSelectV2 queries)
> All paths relative to `PSS_2.0_Backend/PeopleServe/Services/Base/`.

| FK Field | Target Entity | Entity File Path | GQL Query Name (BE handler class) | GQL Field (FE) | Display Field | Response DTO Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| OrganizationalUnitId | OrganizationalUnit | `Base.Domain/Models/ApplicationModels/OrganizationalUnit.cs` | `GetOrganizationalUnitsQuery` → endpoint `GetOrganizationalUnits` | `getOrganizationalUnits` | `UnitName` | `OrganizationalUnitResponseDto` |
| CampaignCategoryId | MasterData (typeCode=CAMPAIGNCATEGORY) | `Base.Domain/Models/SettingModels/MasterData.cs` | `GetMasterDatasQuery` → endpoint `GetMasterDatas` (filter by MasterDataType.TypeCode) | `getMasterDatas` | `DataName` | `MasterDataResponseDto` |
| CampaignTypeId | MasterData (typeCode=CAMPAIGNTYPE) | same | same | `getMasterDatas` | `DataName` | `MasterDataResponseDto` |
| CampaignStatusId | MasterData (typeCode=CAMPAIGNSTATUS) | same | same | `getMasterDatas` | `DataName` | `MasterDataResponseDto` |
| CampaignTaxCategoryId | MasterData (typeCode=CAMPAIGNTAXCATEGORY) | same | same | `getMasterDatas` | `DataName` | `MasterDataResponseDto` |
| GoalCurrencyId | Currency | `Base.Domain/Models/SharedModels/Currency.cs` | `GetCurrenciesQuery` → endpoint `GetCurrencies` | `getCurrencies` | `CurrencyCode` (fallback `CurrencyName`) | `CurrencyResponseDto` |
| CampaignOwnerStaffId | Staff | `Base.Domain/Models/ApplicationModels/Staff.cs` | `GetStaffsQuery` → endpoint `GetStaffs` | `getStaffs` | `FirstName + ' ' + LastName` | `StaffResponseDto` |
| ThankYouEmailTemplateId | EmailTemplate | `Base.Domain/Models/NotifyModels/EmailTemplate.cs` | `GetEmailTemplatesQuery` → endpoint `GetEmailTemplates` | `getEmailTemplates` | `TemplateName` | `EmailTemplateResponseDto` |
| ReceiptEmailTemplateId | EmailTemplate | same | same | same | same | same |
| WhatsAppFollowUpTemplateId | WhatsAppTemplate | `Base.Domain/Models/NotifyModels/WhatsAppTemplate.cs` | `GetWhatsAppTemplatesQuery` → endpoint `GetWhatsAppTemplates` | `getWhatsAppTemplates` | `TemplateName` | `WhatsAppTemplateResponseDto` |
| CampaignDonationPurpose.DonationPurposeId | DonationPurpose | `Base.Domain/Models/DonationModels/DonationPurpose.cs` | `GetDonationPurposesQuery` → endpoint `GetDonationPurposes` | `getDonationPurposes` | `PurposeName` | `DonationPurposeResponseDto` |
| CampaignTeamMember.StaffId | Staff | same as CampaignOwnerStaffId | same | same | same | same |

**Child metric enums (not FK — simple string codes validated via MasterData lookup in seed):**
- `CampaignTrackingMetric.TrackingMetricCode` values: `AMOUNTRAISED`, `DONORCOUNT`, `NEWVSRETURNING`, `AVGDONATION`, `DAILYTREND`, `ORGBREAKDOWN`, `PAYMENTMETHOD`
- `CampaignRecurringFrequency.FrequencyCode` values: `MONTHLY`, `QUARTERLY`, `WEEKLY`, `ANNUAL`
- `CampaignMilestone.StatusCode` values: `REACHED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `UPCOMING` (computed from TargetDate + achieved-amount-vs-target)

---

## ④ Business Rules & Validation

> **Consumer**: BA Agent → Backend Developer (validators) → Frontend Developer (form validation)

### Uniqueness Rules
- `CampaignCode` must be unique per Company (filtered unique index: `IsDeleted = false`). Auto-generate as `CAMP-{YYYY}-{NNNN}` if empty on create (use COALESCE(MAX)+1).
- `CampaignName` must be unique per Company (filtered unique index) — enforce case-insensitively at validator level.
- `CustomCampaignUrl` must be unique per Company when NOT NULL (filtered unique index: `IsDeleted = false AND CustomCampaignUrl IS NOT NULL`).
- **REPLACE the existing broken composite unique index** on `{OrgUnit+Category+Type+Currency+Status+IsActive+Company}` — this is semantically wrong and blocks multiple campaigns of the same type within an OU. Drop it in the migration.

### Required Field Rules
- REQUIRED: `CampaignName`, `CampaignCode` (auto-gen if empty), `OrganizationalUnitId`, `CampaignCategoryId`, `CampaignTypeId`, `CampaignStatusId`, `StartDate`, `GoalAmount`, `ShortDescription`, `Visibility`, at least 1 `CampaignDonationPurpose` (junction row)
- REQUIRED for status ≠ DRAFT: `EndDate`, `GoalCurrencyId`, `CampaignStory` (Full Story)

### Conditional Rules
- If `Visibility = Public` → `CustomCampaignUrl` is allowed (optional); UI exposes the field
- If `Visibility = Internal` → `CustomCampaignUrl` must be null (UI hides field; validator strips)
- If `AllowRecurring = true` → at least 1 `CampaignRecurringFrequency` row required
- If `IsTaxDeductible = true` → `CampaignTaxCategoryId` required
- If status `ACTIVE` → `EndDate > StartDate` and `EndDate ≥ Today`
- Duration (computed, readonly): `EndDate - StartDate` in days — displayed only
- For each `CampaignMilestone`: `TargetDate` must fall between `StartDate` and `EndDate`; `TargetAmount > 0`
- For each `CampaignImpactMetric`: `Value > 0`; Label non-empty
- For each `CampaignSuggestedAmount`: `Amount > 0`; no duplicates

### Business Logic
- `GoalAmount > 0`; `MinDonationAmount ≥ 0` (default 10)
- `ShortDescription` max 200 chars (UI character counter); DB column stays at 1000 for safety
- `ShareDescription` max 160 chars (UI counter)
- `ProgressPercentage` = `(TotalDonationAmount / GoalAmount) * 100` — computed by donation-write-side trigger (out-of-scope; for now, stored value written on update; dashboard computes live from donation aggregates where possible)
- `TotalDonationCount`, `TotalDonorCount` — stored counters; recomputed by `RecomputeCampaignCounters` service (SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER until Donation.CampaignId FK lands on dependent entities — see ⑫)
- Milestone `StatusCode` auto-computed on GetById / Dashboard:
  - If `AchievedAmount ≥ TargetAmount` (using live donation aggregate where possible, else stored `ProgressPercentage * GoalAmount`) → `REACHED`
  - Else if `Today > TargetDate` → `IN_PROGRESS` (over-date but not yet reached)
  - Else if `Today < StartDate` or `TargetDate > Today` → `UPCOMING`
  - Else → `IN_PROGRESS`
- Progress-bar color coding (computed on FE, not stored): `≥80%` → green, `50–79%` → amber, `<50%` → red

### Workflow — 5-state machine (CampaignStatus MasterData)

| State | Code | Color | Meaning | Allowed Transitions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Draft | `DRAFT` | amber `#a16207` | Saved but not launched | → ACTIVE (Publish), → CANCELLED (Cancel) |
| Active | `ACTIVE` | green `#16a34a` | Accepting donations, visible publicly (if Public visibility) | → PAUSED (Pause), → COMPLETED (Manual complete), → CANCELLED |
| Paused | `PAUSED` | grey | Temporarily stopped accepting donations | → ACTIVE (Resume), → CANCELLED, → COMPLETED |
| Completed | `COMPLETED` | blue `#2563eb` | Reached end date or manually completed | Terminal (→ archive only) |
| Cancelled | `CANCELLED` | red `#dc2626` | Aborted | Terminal |
| (Upcoming) | computed | purple `#7c3aed` | `StartDate > Today AND Status = ACTIVE` | — (pseudo-status for grid display only) |

**Transitions:**
- `PublishCampaign` → sets status to ACTIVE (requires Story, EndDate, GoalCurrency)
- `PauseCampaign` → sets status to PAUSED
- `ResumeCampaign` → sets status back to ACTIVE (from PAUSED)
- `CompleteCampaign` → sets status to COMPLETED (triggers final summary calc)
- `CancelCampaign` → sets status to CANCELLED (requires reason — add `CancellationReason` string? field as FUTURE, noted in ISSUE-5)
- `ArchiveCampaign` → soft delete (Archive button in row/detail menu)
- `AutoCompleteOnEndDate = true` + `EndDate = today` + status `ACTIVE` → auto-transition to COMPLETED (daily job — SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER until cron lands)

**Row action visibility matrix (from mockup):**

| Status | Dashboard btn | Edit/View btn | Delete inline | 3-dot menu |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Draft | ❌ | Edit | ✅ | Duplicate |
| Upcoming (Active + StartDate>today) | ❌ | Edit | ❌ | Duplicate / Archive / Cancel |
| Active | ✅ Dashboard | Edit | ❌ | Duplicate / Archive / Cancel |
| Paused | ✅ | Edit | ❌ | Duplicate / Archive / Cancel |
| Completed | ✅ | View (read-only) | ❌ | Duplicate / Archive |
| Cancelled | ❌ | View | ❌ | Duplicate |

## ⑤ Screen Classification & Pattern Selection

> **Consumer**: Solution Resolver — PRE-ANSWERED decisions based on mockup analysis.

**Screen Type**: FLOW
**Type Classification**: Transactional entity with rich multi-tab FORM + multi-section analytics DETAIL dashboard + status workflow + child collections (7 child tables). Canonical reference: `SavedFilter` + `MatchingGift` (blended — SavedFilter for FLOW URL-mode pattern, MatchingGift for child-collection cascade + tabbed form + multiple new MasterData typeCodes + migration).
**Reason**: `+Add` navigates to `?mode=new` (URL mode dispatch), not a modal. Form is multi-tab, detail view is a rich analytics dashboard (different UI from form). Workflow with 5 states + 6 status-transition commands. Multi-FK dropdown + junction tables.

**Backend Patterns Required:**
- [x] Standard CRUD (11 files) — existing; extend Create/Update/GetAll/GetById
- [x] Tenant scoping (CompanyId from HttpContext)
- [x] Nested child creation + diff-persist (5 child entities + 2 junction tables)
- [x] Multi-FK validation (ValidateForeignKeyRecord × 9)
- [x] Unique validation — `CampaignName`, `CampaignCode`, `CustomCampaignUrl` (all per Company + filtered)
- [x] Workflow commands (Publish, Pause, Resume, Complete, Cancel, Archive — 6 transition commands)
- [x] Summary query — `GetCampaignSummary` (4 KPI cards for list)
- [x] Dashboard query — `GetCampaignDashboard(campaignId)` (8-section analytics)
- [x] Duplicate command — `DuplicateCampaign` (clone + "(Copy)" suffix + children)
- [x] Custom business rule validators — visibility-aware URL, milestone-in-range, recurring-freq-required-when-allow-recurring, delete-blocked-if-donations-exist
- [ ] File upload command — deferred to SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER (see ⑫)

**Frontend Patterns Required:**
- [x] FlowDataTable (grid) — REPLACE existing `AdvancedDataTable` stub
- [x] **view-page.tsx with 3 URL modes** (new, edit, read)
- [x] React Hook Form (for FORM layout — 4 tabs)
- [x] Zustand store (`campaign-store.ts`)
- [x] Unsaved changes dialog
- [x] FlowFormPageHeader (Back + Save/Edit/Publish buttons)
- [x] Child grid inside form — 2 (ImpactMetrics, Milestones)
- [x] Multi-select junction UIs — 3 (DonationPurposes chips, TeamMembers chips, SuggestedAmounts tag-input)
- [x] Checkbox groups — 2 (TrackingMetrics, RecurringFrequencies)
- [x] Card selector — Visibility radio (2 cards: Public/Internal)
- [x] Workflow status badge + action buttons (6 transitions)
- [x] Summary cards / count widgets above grid (4 KPIs — Variant B)
- [x] Filter chip bar (6 chips with live counts)
- [x] **Detail dashboard layout** — 8 analytical sections (hero / KPI strip / 2 charts / 2 tables / tracker / feed / leaderboard)
- [ ] Rich text editor — reuse if exists, else CREATE `rich-text-editor.tsx` (quill/tiptap — check repo)
- [ ] File upload widget — reuse if exists, else SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER button
- [x] Grid aggregation columns — Progress bar (per-row), Raised (live aggregate via subquery or stored counter fallback)

## ⑥ UI/UX Blueprint

> **Consumer**: UX Architect → Frontend Developer
> Extracted directly from HTML mockups — this IS the design spec.
> **Layout Variant**: `widgets-above-grid` → FE Dev uses **Variant B** (ScreenHeader + widgets + DataTableContainer with showHeader=false). MANDATORY to avoid double-header bug (ContactType #19 precedent).

### Grid/List View

**Display Mode**: `table` (standard HTML table — not card-grid. Campaigns have too many columns for a card layout and the progress-bar column needs horizontal real estate.)

**Grid Columns** (11 columns, in display order):

| # | Column Header | Field Key | Display Type | Width | Sortable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Campaign Name | `campaignName` | text-link | auto/flex | YES | Click → `?mode=read&id={id}` |
| 2 | Category | `campaignCategoryName` | category-emoji-badge | 180px | YES | e.g., "🌙 Seasonal" — emoji stored in MasterData.DataSetting.icon |
| 3 | Org Unit | `organizationalUnitName` | text | 150px | YES | — |
| 4 | Goal | `goalAmount` | currency | 130px | YES | Right-aligned, currency symbol from `goalCurrencyCode` |
| 5 | Raised | `raisedAmount` | currency-bold | 130px | YES | Em-dash if null (Draft/Upcoming); bold green text |
| 6 | Progress | `progressPercentage` | campaign-progress-bar | 150px (min) | YES | Inline 6px bar + % text below; color-coded (≥80 green / 50–79 amber / <50 red) |
| 7 | Donors | `totalDonorCount` | integer | 100px | YES | Em-dash if 0/null |
| 8 | Status | `campaignStatusCode` | campaign-status-badge | 120px | YES | Dot/icon + label pill; includes computed "Upcoming" state (Active + StartDate>today) |
| 9 | Start | `startDate` | date-short | 100px | YES | "Mar 1" format; em-dash if Draft |
| 10 | End | `endDate` | date-short | 100px | YES | "Apr 30" format; em-dash if Draft |
| 11 | Actions | — | action-buttons + 3-dot | 140px | NO | Status-dependent (see ④ matrix) |

**Grid Cell Renderers (new components — check registries before creating):**
- `campaign-progress-bar` — inline progress bar renderer (6px height, color-coded)
- `category-emoji-badge` — emoji prefix + text (e.g., "🌙 Seasonal") using DataSetting.icon
- `campaign-status-badge` — REUSE existing `status-badge` renderer if possible (stamp via MasterData.DataSetting.colorHex + icon)
- `campaign-name-link` — linked text cell (or reuse existing `text-link` / navigate-on-click)

Register all NEW renderers in all 3 column-type registries (`advanced-component-column.tsx` + `basic-component-column.tsx` + `flow-component-column.tsx`) and export via `shared-cell-renderers` barrel.

**Summary Widgets (Variant B — 4 KPI cards above grid):**

| # | Widget Title | Value Source (GQL field) | Display Type | Icon | Icon Color |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Active Campaigns | `summary.activeCampaignsCount` + subtitle "Ending this month: {N}" (`endingThisMonthCount`) | integer + subtitle | fa-bullhorn | Teal |
| 2 | Total Raised (Active) | `summary.totalRaisedActive` + subtitle "Goal: {totalGoalActive} ({pct}%)" | currency + subtitle | fa-hand-holding-dollar | Green |
| 3 | Avg. Performance | `summary.avgPerformancePct` (%) + subtitle "Best: {bestCampaignName} ({bestPct}%)" | percentage + subtitle | fa-chart-line | Blue |
| 4 | Donors Reached (Active) | `summary.donorsReachedActive` + subtitle "New donors: {newDonorsCount} ({newDonorsPct}%)" | integer + subtitle | fa-users | Purple |

**Summary GQL Query**: `GetCampaignSummary` → returns `CampaignSummaryDto` — see ⑩.

**Filter Chip Bar** (pill-shaped, below widget row, above filter bar):

| Chip | Count source |
|---|---|
| All | `summary.totalAllCount` |
| Active | `summary.activeCampaignsCount` |
| Upcoming | `summary.upcomingCount` |
| Completed | `summary.completedCount` |
| Draft | `summary.draftCount` |
| Cancelled | `summary.cancelledCount` |

Chip click → sets Zustand filter chip + pushes `statusCode` arg to `GetAllCampaignList` query.

**Filter Bar** (horizontal row):
- **Search** — text, placeholder "Search campaigns..." — searches `campaignName`, `campaignCode`, `shortDescription`, OrgUnit name/code
- **Org Unit** — dropdown (`ApiSelectV2` → `getOrganizationalUnits`) — All Org Units default
- **Category** — dropdown (`ApiSelectV2` → `getMasterDatas` filtered by `CAMPAIGNCATEGORY`) — All Categories default
- **Date Range** — two `<input type="date">` inputs — filters on StartDate/EndDate overlap with range
- **Clear Filters** — button, danger hover

**Grid Actions (row-level, status-dependent)**:
- **Draft**: `Edit` (→ `?mode=edit`) + inline `Delete` button + 3-dot `Duplicate`
- **Upcoming**: `Edit` + 3-dot (`Duplicate`, `Archive`, `Cancel`)
- **Active/Paused**: `Dashboard` (→ `?mode=read`) + `Edit` + 3-dot (`Duplicate`, `Archive`, `Cancel`)
- **Completed/Cancelled**: `Dashboard` + `View` (→ `?mode=read` in disabled form OR detail) + 3-dot (`Duplicate`, `Archive`)

**Bulk Actions**: None in mockup.

**Page Header Actions (list page)**:
- `Export` button (outline accent) → SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER (PDF/CSV export of filtered list)
- `New Campaign` button (filled accent, fa-plus) → navigates to `?mode=new`

**Row Click**: Navigates to `?mode=read&id={id}` (DETAIL dashboard) — EXCEPT Draft/Cancelled where it goes to `?mode=edit`.

### FLOW View-Page — 3 URL Modes & 2 Distinct UI Layouts

> `view-page.tsx` must handle:
> - `?mode=new` → **FORM LAYOUT** (empty, 4 tabs)
> - `?mode=edit&id=X` → **FORM LAYOUT** (pre-filled, 4 tabs)
> - `?mode=read&id=X` → **DETAIL LAYOUT** (completely different UI: analytics dashboard with 8 sections)
>
> Compose via `<CampaignFormPage>` vs `<CampaignDetailPage>` inner components, branched on `mode`.

---

  - `Save as Draft` (outline accent, fa-save) → sets status=DRAFT
  - `Save & Publish` (filled accent, fa-paper-plane) → sets status=ACTIVE (if allowed per ④ workflow)
- Sticky footer with same 3 actions
- Unsaved-changes dialog on dirty navigation

**Section Container Type**: `tabs` (4 horizontal tabs, content panels mutually exclusive)

- Tab 1 Visibility = Internal → hides Tab 4 Custom URL field
- Tab 3 Auto-complete toggle ON → enables backend daily-job flag (SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER)
- Tab 3 Start/End date change → Duration field auto-updates (readonly)
- Milestone status badge color-coded based on real-time computation (GetById returns live status)

---

**Child Grids in Form** (both use `useFieldArray`):
| Child | Grid Columns | Add Method | Delete | Persistence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ImpactMetrics | Icon (emoji) / Label / Value / Unit | "+ Add Impact Metric" button below table | Trash icon per row | Diff-persist on save — ordered by OrderBy |

---

#### LAYOUT 2: DETAIL (mode=read) — Analytics Dashboard (DIFFERENT UI)

> **This is NOT the form with fields disabled.** It's a rich analytics dashboard with 8 distinct sections.
> File: `campaign-detail.tsx` (or inline branch in view-page.tsx).
> Data source: `GetCampaignDashboard(campaignId)` — see ⑩.

**Page Header** (FlowFormPageHeader):
- Left: Back button → `/crm/organization/campaign`

- Right actions:
  - `Edit Campaign` (outline accent, fa-pen) → `?mode=edit&id=X`
  - `Share Link` (outline accent, fa-share-alt) → copies `CustomCampaignUrl` to clipboard (SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER)
  - `Export Report` (outline accent, fa-file-export) → SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER (PDF report)

- Data: `dashboard.topDonors[]: { rank, donorContactId, donorName, donationCount, totalAmount }`

---

### Page Widgets & Summary Cards — GridLayoutVariant

**Grid Layout Variant**: `widgets-above-grid` → **Variant B MANDATORY** (ScreenHeader + widgets + `<FlowDataTableContainer showHeader={false}>`). Violating this triggers double-header UI bug (ContactType #19 precedent).

**Summary GQL Query**: `GetCampaignSummary` → `CampaignSummaryDto` — see ⑩.

### Grid Aggregation Columns

| Column | Description | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Raised | Sum of confirmed donations for this campaign | Project from `TotalDonationAmount` stored counter in Phase 1. Phase 2 (when GlobalDonation.CampaignId FK lands): LINQ subquery `SUM(Amount) WHERE CampaignId = row.CampaignId AND PaymentStatusCode='PAID'` |
| Progress | `Raised / Goal * 100` | Stored `ProgressPercentage` in Phase 1; live compute post-FK |
| Donors | Distinct donor count | Stored `TotalDonorCount` in Phase 1; live `COUNT(DISTINCT ContactId)` post-FK |

---

### User Interaction Flow (FLOW — 3 modes, 2 UI layouts)

1. Grid → `+New Campaign` → `?mode=new` → **FORM LAYOUT** (Tab 1 active, empty)
2. User fills 4 tabs → `Save as Draft` or `Save & Publish` → API creates → URL → `?mode=read&id={newId}` → **DETAIL DASHBOARD**
3. Grid row click (Active/Completed) → `?mode=read&id={id}` → DETAIL DASHBOARD
4. Grid row click (Draft) → `?mode=edit&id={id}` → FORM LAYOUT pre-filled
5. Detail page `Edit` button → `?mode=edit&id={id}` → FORM pre-filled → Save → back to DETAIL
6. 3-dot row action `Duplicate` → calls `duplicateCampaign` mutation → redirects to `?mode=edit&id={newClonedId}` with "(Copy)" suffix
7. 3-dot `Archive` → confirmation modal → `archiveCampaign` mutation → sets IsDeleted=true + IsActive=false
8. 3-dot `Cancel` → confirmation modal → `cancelCampaign` mutation → status=CANCELLED
9. Filter chip click → Zustand updates `statusFilter` → refetches GetAll with statusCode arg
10. Back button → `/crm/organization/campaign` → grid list
11. Unsaved changes dialog on dirty FORM navigate

## ⑦ Substitution Guide

> **Consumer**: Backend Developer + Frontend Developer
> Maps the canonical reference entity to THIS entity.

**Canonical Reference**: SavedFilter (for FLOW pattern + new MasterData typeCodes) + MatchingGift (for multi-child-collection + migration + tabbed form with status workflow).

| Canonical | → Campaign | Context |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| SavedFilter | Campaign | Entity name |
| savedFilter | campaign | Variable/camelCase |
| SavedFilterId | CampaignId | PK field |
| SavedFilters | Campaigns | Table name / collection |
| saved-filter | campaign | FE kebab / filename |
| savedfilter | campaign | FE folder slug |
| SAVEDFILTER | CAMPAIGN | Grid code / menu code (already exists in DecoratorApplicationModules) |
| notify | app | DB schema |
| NotifyModels | ApplicationModels | Backend domain group folder |
| NotifyDbContext | ContactDbContext | DbContext (interface: IContactDbContext) |
| NotifyMappings | ContactMappings | Mapster mappings file |
| DecoratorNotifyModules | DecoratorApplicationModules | Decorator class |
| CRM_COMMUNICATION | CRM_ORGANIZATION | Parent menu code |
| CRM | CRM | Module code (same) |
| crm/communication/savedfilter | crm/organization/campaign | FE route path (ALREADY EXISTS — preserve) |
| notify-service | contact-service | FE service folder (preserve — Campaign lives here historically) |
| notify-queries | contact-queries | FE GQL queries folder |
| notify-mutations | contact-mutations | FE GQL mutations folder |

**Key divergences from SavedFilter canonical:**
- Campaign has **5 child entities + 2 junction tables** (vs. SavedFilter's 0). Follow MatchingGift pattern for cascade + diff-persist.
- Campaign form is **tabs** (vs. SavedFilter's split-pane sections).
- Campaign has a **true multi-section analytics DETAIL** layout (vs. SavedFilter's no-separate-detail: "form disabled" approach). Do NOT wrap form in fieldset for Campaign read mode.
- Campaign needs **6 status-transition commands** (vs. SavedFilter's 0).

## ⑪ Acceptance Criteria

**Build Verification:**
- [ ] `dotnet build` — 0 errors
- [ ] `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — 0 new Campaign errors
- [ ] Migration applies cleanly on empty DB
- [ ] Migration preserves existing Campaign data (no data loss)
- [ ] Migration snapshot regenerated (or user prompted to run `dotnet ef migrations add` locally)

**Functional Verification (Full E2E — MANDATORY):**

### List Page
- [ ] Loads at `/[lang]/crm/organization/campaign`
- [ ] 4 KPI widgets render above grid with live summary counts
- [ ] 6 filter chips render with live counts; clicking updates grid
- [ ] Grid loads with 11 columns; pagination works
- [ ] Search box filters across name/code/description/OU name
- [ ] OrgUnit dropdown filter fires ApiSelectV2; Category dropdown fires ApiSelectV2
- [ ] Date range filter works (StartDate/EndDate overlap)
- [ ] Row click navigates to `?mode=read&id={id}` (except Draft/Cancelled → `?mode=edit`)
- [ ] Row action buttons vary per status per ④ matrix
- [ ] Progress bar column renders correctly with color coding (green/amber/red)
- [ ] Status badge column renders correctly with dot/icon + correct color from MasterData.DataSetting
- [ ] Category emoji badge renders correctly
- [ ] `+New Campaign` button navigates to `?mode=new`

### FORM LAYOUT (mode=new, mode=edit)
- [ ] Page loads with FlowFormPageHeader + 4 tabs; Tab 1 active by default
- [ ] Tab 1 fields all functional: CampaignName, CampaignCode (auto-gen hint), Category (emoji dropdown), Org Unit (hierarchical), DonationPurposes chip multi-select (chips removable), Status, Visibility card selector
- [ ] Tab 2 fields all functional: Short Description (with char counter), Full Story (rich-text editor), Banner upload (SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER toast), Video URL, Impact Metrics child grid (add/remove rows), Testimonial quote + photo
- [ ] Tab 3 fields all functional: Goal Amount, Goal Currency dropdown, Min Donation, Suggested Amounts tag input, Start/End dates, Duration readonly auto-updates, Auto-complete toggle, Milestones child grid with status badges, Tracking Metrics checkbox grid
- [ ] Tab 4 fields all functional: Allow Recurring toggle (conditional frequencies), Tax Deductible toggle (conditional Tax Category), 3 Template dropdowns, Campaign Team chip picker, Custom URL (conditional on Public visibility), Share Title/Description/Image, Social Preview Card live updates
- [ ] Save as Draft sets status=DRAFT and saves
- [ ] Save & Publish sets status=ACTIVE and validates required publish fields (Story, EndDate, GoalCurrency)
- [ ] On save → URL changes to `?mode=read&id={newId}` → DETAIL loads
- [ ] On edit save → URL returns to `?mode=read&id={id}` → DETAIL loads
- [ ] Unsaved changes dialog on dirty navigation
- [ ] Cancel button with confirmation

### DETAIL LAYOUT (mode=read)
- [ ] Header: back, breadcrumb, CampaignName, badges row (category emoji + status dot + elapsed text), 3 action buttons
- [ ] Goal Progress Hero: large raised/goal text + thick progress bar + % + inline stats + projection line
- [ ] KPI Strip: 6 cards with values + subtitles
- [ ] Daily Collection Trend: bar chart renders with spike highlight
- [ ] Donor Breakdown: donut chart with center count + 2-segment legend
- [ ] By Org Unit table: rows with clickable unit names + trend arrows
- [ ] By Payment Method table: rows with emoji + method + amounts
- [ ] Milestone Tracker: horizontal step tracker with colored dots per state
- [ ] Recent Donations Feed: rows with time + avatar + donor name (linked) + amount
- [ ] Top Donors Leaderboard: 5 rows with rank medals/numbers + linked names + totals
- [ ] Edit button → `?mode=edit&id={id}` → FORM pre-filled
- [ ] Share Link button shows SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER toast
- [ ] Export Report button shows SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER toast

### Workflow Actions
- [ ] Duplicate row action: creates copy with "(Copy)" name, new CampaignCode, status=DRAFT, redirects to new record's `?mode=edit`
- [ ] Publish (Save & Publish): sets status=ACTIVE (validator enforces required)
- [ ] Pause button (detail/row): status ACTIVE → PAUSED
- [ ] Resume button: PAUSED → ACTIVE
- [ ] Complete button: → COMPLETED (terminal)
- [ ] Cancel row action: modal with reason → CANCELLED
- [ ] Archive row action: confirmation → IsDeleted=true, IsActive=false (disappears from grid)
- [ ] Delete (Draft only): soft delete with confirmation
- [ ] In-use check: Delete blocks if donations reference (SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER until FK lands)

**DB Seed Verification:**
- [ ] Menu appears in sidebar under CRM > Organization > Campaigns at OrderBy=2
- [ ] MenuCapabilities: READ/CREATE/MODIFY/DELETE/TOGGLE/IMPORT/EXPORT/ISMENURENDER all seeded
- [ ] BUSINESSADMIN RoleCapabilities granted for READ/CREATE/MODIFY/DELETE/TOGGLE/IMPORT/EXPORT
- [ ] Grid seeded with gridType=FLOW, 11 columns in correct order
- [ ] GridFormSchema NOT seeded (SKIP per FLOW convention)
- [ ] MasterDataTypes CAMPAIGNCATEGORY, CAMPAIGNSTATUS, CAMPAIGNTAXCATEGORY, CAMPAIGNTRACKINGMETRIC, RECURRINGFREQUENCY seeded
- [ ] MasterDatas under each type seeded with correct TypeCode, DataCode, DataName, DataSetting (ColorHex for statuses, icon for categories)
- [ ] Sample campaign rows seeded (3-4) for manual QA
- [ ] Seed SQL is idempotent (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING or NOT EXISTS guards)

**UI Uniformity (5-check grep — must all return 0 matches):**
- [ ] No inline hex colors in Campaign files except `campaign-status-badge` and `campaign-progress-bar` (data-driven)
- [ ] No inline pixel spacing in Campaign files
- [ ] Variant B confirmed: `<ScreenHeader>` in `index-page.tsx` + `<FlowDataTableContainer showHeader={false}>` in data table
- [ ] No raw "Loading..." strings — use `<Skeleton>` / `<LayoutLoader>`
- [ ] No @iconify classes without Phosphor prefix

## ⑫ Special Notes & Warnings

> **Consumer**: All agents — things that are easy to get wrong.

### Schema & Path Conventions
- **CompanyId IS a field** on Campaign (preserved) — set from HttpContext on create (DO NOT pass from FE)
- **FLOW screens do NOT generate GridFormSchema** in DB seed — SKIP it
- **Schema is `app` (per snapshot)** — but ISSUE-1 flags a discrepancy where migration created in `corg`. Migration must be explicit about final schema.
- **Group folder is `ApplicationModels`, NOT `OrgModels` or `CampModels`** (Campaigns historically live here with Company/OU/Staff/Branch/Event/Product)
- **DbContext is `ContactDbContext`, NOT `ApplicationDbContext`** — this is the historical grouping for domain entities in schema `app`+`corg`+`fund`+`sett` etc.
- **Mappings file is `ContactMappings.cs`, NOT `ApplicationMappings.cs`**
- **FE folder is `contact-service`, NOT `application-service` or `organization-service`** — historical grouping, preserve for ALIGN scope
- **FE route already exists at `src/app/[lang]/crm/organization/campaign/page.tsx`** — reuse
- **Duplicate FE route at `src/app/[lang]/organization/organizationsetup/campaign/page.tsx`** — DELETE during build to avoid route collision
- **view-page.tsx handles ALL 3 modes** — new/edit share FORM layout; read has DETAIL dashboard (completely different UI — NOT just form disabled)

### ALIGN Caveats
- ALIGN ≠ do less — every mockup element is in scope (see GOLDEN RULE in SKILL.md)
- Preserve existing BE entity fields + commands + queries; extend, don't recreate
- Preserve existing FE DTO/Query/Mutation file names; extend
- Preserve `OrganizationalCampaignResponseDto` + `GetOrganizationCampaignByIdQuery` + `CAMPAIGN_BY_ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT_QUERY` — they're used by the Organizational Unit wizard (see embedded form at `page-components/crm/organization/organizationalunit/organizationalcampaign/*`). DO NOT delete.
- Review embedded OU-wizard form (`campaign-form-fields.tsx` + `campaign-tab.tsx` + `campaign-grid-tab.tsx` + `campaign-validation-schema.ts`) and decide whether to refactor for shared DTO or keep inline. Recommended: keep inline for this session; flag ISSUE-6 for future consolidation.

### Campaign Entity Inverse-Navigation Typo Cleanup
Multiple sibling entities declare inverse navigations with a typo (`CompaignCategories`, `CompaignTypes`, `Compaigns`, `CompaignStatuses`). The BE agent should:
1. Rename these inverse nav collections to `CampaignCategories`, `CampaignTypes`, `Campaigns`, `CampaignStatuses` on MasterData.cs and Currency.cs
2. Fix the EF configuration references in `CampaignConfiguration.cs`
3. Update any LINQ projections in other queries that reference the typo'd names
4. This is a small-blast-radius rename but MUST be done — otherwise the model snapshot won't regenerate cleanly

### Downstream FK Additions (out-of-scope for this screen but required for full feature)
- `GlobalDonation.CampaignId` FK — NOT YET ADDED. Without it, the dashboard's `totalRaised`/`totalDonors`/`recentDonations`/`topDonors`/`orgUnitBreakdown`/`paymentMethodBreakdown`/`dailyTrend` all return mock/zero data. Flag as SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER with a clear comment in `GetCampaignDashboard` handler. ADD in a separate future PR (like Branch #41 added Staff.BranchId FK).
- `Event.CampaignId` FK — REMOVED in the 2025-11 migration (was `RelatedCompaignId`). Similarly deferred.
- `Pledge.CampaignId` FK — new entity; add when Pledge #12 is built.
- `MatchingGift.CampaignId` FK — built in MatchingGift #11 (verify before coding — dashboard rollup depends on it).
- `P2PCampaign.ParentCampaignId` FK — out of scope for #39 (build P2P Campaign #15 first).

### Service Dependencies

> Everything shown in the mockup is in scope. The following are UI-only with handler placeholders — full UI is built, only the backend service call is mocked:

- **SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER: Rich-text editor (Full Story)** — if no library exists in repo. Check for `react-quill` / `tiptap` / similar. If absent: use `<textarea>` with basic toolbar-mock + toast explaining "Rich-text editing requires quill/tiptap install — add dependency in next iteration."
- **SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER: Image upload (Banner, Testimonial Photo, Share Image)** — no CDN service exists yet. Full UI: drag-and-drop area, preview thumbnail, remove. Handler: reads File object, stores base64 URL in state, shows toast "Image upload stubbed — will persist to CDN when upload-service exists."
- **SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER: Video URL preview** — ToYouTube/Vimeo embed requires iframe fetch. MVP: show URL as plain text in read mode.
- **SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER: Daily Collection Trend data / Donor Breakdown / Top Donors / Recent Donations** — all 4 dashboard aggregations depend on GlobalDonation having a CampaignId FK (not yet added). Handler returns empty arrays + toast note. UI renders empty-state skeletons gracefully.
- **SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER: Projected Amount** — pace-projection requires historical donation event stream + linear regression. Handler returns `projectedAmount = totalRaised * 1.1` as a placeholder.
- **SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER: Conversion Rate** — requires web analytics integration (page view tracking). Handler returns 0.
- **SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER: Share Link copy** — UI button implemented, clipboard-write handler included, but relies on frontend-only clipboard API (browser-native — actually WORKS). Remove placeholder label if `navigator.clipboard.writeText` is available (it is — modern browsers).
- **SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER: Export Report (PDF)** — PDF generation service absent. Toast mock.
- **SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER: Export List (CSV)** — the existing `ExportController.ExportCampaignData` REST handler exists but the FE button needs to call it; if the service returns empty column list for new fields, BE must align Export Handler. Toast fallback.
- **SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER: Auto-complete on end date (cron job)** — requires scheduled background service. Flag the column + setting, but do not trigger automatically. Manual `CompleteCampaign` command is the only path for now.
- **SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER: Email/WhatsApp template auto-send on donation** — requires message dispatcher. Settings tab stores the chosen template IDs; dispatch is out of scope until communication infra is wired.
- **SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER: Custom URL slug public landing page** — the slug is stored; public page rendering is a separate FE project.

Full UI must be built for ALL items above. Only the handler for the external service is mocked (toast + state update).

### Pre-Flagged Known Issues (will be logged by /build-screen)

| ID | Severity | Area | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| ISSUE-1 | HIGH | BE | Schema discrepancy — entity snapshot says `app.Campaigns` but migration creates in `corg`. Migration must verify + explicitly set final schema. |
| ISSUE-2 | HIGH | BE | Broken composite unique index on {OrgUnit+Category+Type+Currency+Status+IsActive+Company} blocks legitimate duplicate categories — MUST DROP during migration. |
| ISSUE-3 | MED | BE | `GetCampaign.cs` — `ApplyGridFeatures` bug (passes `baseQuery` not `compaignsQuery`). Fix during handler extension. |
| ISSUE-4 | MED | BE | MasterData inverse-nav typos (`CompaignCategories` etc.) must be renamed — snapshot regeneration fails otherwise. |
| ISSUE-5 | LOW | BE | `CancellationReason` column not in scope for this screen — add as optional future feature. Cancel command accepts `reason` param for FUTURE use. |
| ISSUE-6 | MED | FE | Embedded OU-wizard form (`campaign-form-fields.tsx`) duplicates form logic — keep inline for this session; flag for consolidation in future refactor. |
| ISSUE-7 | HIGH | BE/FE | `GlobalDonation.CampaignId` FK NOT YET ADDED — dashboard aggregations will be stubbed/zero until this FK lands in a future PR. |
| ISSUE-8 | MED | BE | `Event.CampaignId` FK was removed in 2025-11 migration — recent donations feed / org unit breakdown also limited until re-added. |
| ISSUE-9 | MED | FE | Rich-text editor library absent — if detected, fall back to textarea + SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER annotation. |
| ISSUE-10 | MED | FE | Image upload service absent — 3 file upload fields all use placeholder handlers. |
| ISSUE-11 | LOW | BE | `TotalDonationCount` / `TotalDonorCount` / `ProgressPercentage` are stored counters — recomputation trigger is out-of-scope. Manual refresh via future `RefreshCampaignCountersCommand`. |
| ISSUE-12 | LOW | FE | Chart library selection — check repo for recharts/apexcharts/chart.js. Default to whichever is already in use. If none: create minimal SVG fallback for detail page charts. |
| ISSUE-13 | LOW | BE | Seed folder path `sql-scripts-dyanmic` (misspelled `dyanmic`) — preserve repo convention (from EmailTemplate #24 precedent). |
| ISSUE-14 | MED | FE | Campaign form currently uses inline OU-wizard pattern with `CampaignPageConfig` → `<CampaignDataTable>` (read-only). Replacing with full 3-mode router is a significant FE rewrite. Existing file manifest anticipates DELETE of `data-table.tsx`. |
| ISSUE-15 | LOW | BE | `CampaignDto` stub (empty class extending CampaignResponseDto) + duplicate Mapster `<Campaign, CampaignDto>` config — can be removed during Mappings cleanup. |
| ISSUE-16 | MED | FE | Grid row click destination varies by status (Draft → edit, others → read) — implement conditionally in `onRowClick` callback; document in `campaign-store.ts`. |
| ISSUE-17 | LOW | BE | `ExportCampaignData` is REST-only (not GQL) — align new fields in `ExportController` field mapping. Alternatively, add GQL `exportCampaign` for consistency. |
| ISSUE-18 | MED | Seed | Milestone status-code computation is live (not stored) — seed samples should use `StatusCode=NULL` and rely on runtime calc in `GetCampaignDashboard`. |

|----|------------------|----------|------|-------------|--------|
| ISSUE-1 | Planning 2026-04-20 | HIGH | BE | Schema `app` vs migration's `corg` discrepancy — migration must explicitly set schema | RESOLVED — migration + EF config explicitly use schema `app` (Session 1) |
| ISSUE-2 | Planning 2026-04-20 | HIGH | BE | Drop broken composite unique index on {OrgUnit+Category+Type+Currency+Status+IsActive+Company} | RESOLVED — migration drops old index, adds 3 filtered unique indexes on Name/Code/CustomUrl (Session 1) |
| ISSUE-3 | Planning 2026-04-20 | MED | BE | `GetCampaign.cs` — `ApplyGridFeatures` bug passes `baseQuery` not filtered query | RESOLVED — handler now passes filtered `campaignsQuery` (Session 1) |
| ISSUE-4 | Planning 2026-04-20 | MED | BE | MasterData inverse-nav typos (`CompaignCategories`, `CompaignTypes`, `Compaigns`, `CompaignStatuses`) — rename required | RESOLVED — MasterData.cs + Currency.cs + EF config + LINQ all renamed; `Compaign` typos remain only in ToggleCampaign.cs (KEEP-AS-IS file) + EF snapshot (auto-regen on `dotnet ef migrations add`) (Session 1) |
| ISSUE-5 | Planning 2026-04-20 | LOW | BE | CancellationReason column not in scope — add as future enhancement | RESOLVED — CancelCampaign accepts optional `reason` param; currently appended to Note field; dedicated column deferred (Session 1) |
| ISSUE-6 | Planning 2026-04-20 | MED | FE | Embedded OU-wizard Campaign form duplicates form logic — flag for future consolidation | OPEN — kept inline this session per plan; logged for future consolidation |
| ISSUE-7 | Planning 2026-04-20 | HIGH | BE/FE | `GlobalDonation.CampaignId` FK NOT YET ADDED — dashboard aggregations stubbed | OPEN — SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER: dashboard charts/feed/leaderboard/breakdowns return empty arrays. FE degrades gracefully with empty-states |
| ISSUE-8 | Planning 2026-04-20 | MED | BE | `Event.CampaignId` FK removed in 2025-11 migration — re-add in future PR | OPEN — same rationale as ISSUE-7 |
| ISSUE-9 | Planning 2026-04-20 | MED | FE | Rich-text editor library may be absent — confirm during build | RESOLVED — TipTap installed; reused existing `minimal-tiptap-editor` component for Tab 2 Full Story (NO SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER needed) (Session 1) |
| ISSUE-10 | Planning 2026-04-20 | MED | FE | Image upload service absent — 3 fields use placeholder handlers | OPEN — `image-upload-field.tsx` wraps toast mock for Banner/Testimonial/ShareImage |
| ISSUE-11 | Planning 2026-04-20 | LOW | BE | Stored counters (TotalDonationCount, TotalDonorCount, ProgressPercentage) lack auto-recompute trigger | OPEN — manual refresh via future `RefreshCampaignCountersCommand` |
| ISSUE-12 | Planning 2026-04-20 | LOW | FE | Chart library selection pending repo check | RESOLVED — `react-apexcharts` already installed; used for Daily Collection bar chart + Donor Breakdown donut (Session 1) |
| ISSUE-13 | Planning 2026-04-20 | LOW | BE | Seed folder path `sql-scripts-dyanmic` misspelled — preserve convention | RESOLVED — seed placed in `sql-scripts-dyanmic/` (typo preserved) (Session 1) |
| ISSUE-14 | Planning 2026-04-20 | MED | FE | Existing `data-table.tsx` stub DELETE required during rewrite | RESOLVED — stub neutralized to `export {};` tombstone (full deletion blocked by sandbox — see ISSUE-19) (Session 1) |
| ISSUE-15 | Planning 2026-04-20 | LOW | BE | `CampaignDto` empty stub + duplicate Mapster config — cleanup during Mappings update | RESOLVED — stub removed, duplicate Mapster config cleaned in ContactMappings.cs (Session 1) |
| ISSUE-16 | Planning 2026-04-20 | MED | FE | Grid row click destination varies by status — implement conditional onRowClick | PARTIAL — `decideRowClickMode(statusCode)` helper exported from campaign-store.ts; grid-level onRowClick binding deferred (FlowDataTable hook pattern — see ISSUE-20) |
| ISSUE-17 | Planning 2026-04-20 | LOW | BE | `ExportCampaignData` REST-only (not GQL) — align new fields in ExportController | OPEN — see ISSUE-21 (new fields flow through reflection; filter args not wired) |
| ISSUE-18 | Planning 2026-04-20 | MED | Seed | Milestone StatusCode live-computed — seed samples should use NULL | RESOLVED — GetCampaignDashboard computes statusCode at runtime; no stored value (Session 1) |
| ISSUE-19 | Session 1 2026-04-21 | LOW | BE/FE | Team-handles-migrations: manually-written migration file lacks Designer.cs + snapshot updates. FE: 2 files (`data-table.tsx`, legacy `organization/organizationsetup/campaign/page.tsx`) neutralized in place; physical `git rm` required outside sandbox | OPEN |
| ISSUE-20 | Session 1 2026-04-21 | LOW | BE | Grid seed uses CAMPAIGN_NAME FieldId as placeholder for Category/Org Unit/Status cells (label resolves via `parentObject`+ValueSource JSON). Future refinement could introduce explicit FK-label Fields if `FieldCode` uniqueness-per-(Grid,OrderBy) is desired | OPEN |
| ISSUE-21 | Session 1 2026-04-21 | LOW | BE | `ExportCampaign.cs` inherits new projected columns via reflection but does NOT pass new filter args (statusCode/orgUnitId/categoryId/dateFrom/dateTo) — filters on list page are NOT applied to Excel export | OPEN |
| ISSUE-22 | Session 1 2026-04-21 | LOW | BE | `DuplicateCampaign` calls `CreateCampaignHandler.GenerateCampaignCodeAsync` statically (`internal static`) — unit tests mocking this method will need an alternative (inject code-generator service) | OPEN |
| ISSUE-23 | Session 1 2026-04-21 | LOW | FE | `campaignOwnerStaffId` carried on Request DTO + mutation but not surfaced as UI field (mockup has no Owner picker) — writes `null` on every save until Owner picker is added to Tab 1 or Tab 4 | OPEN |
| ISSUE-24 | Session 1 2026-04-21 | LOW | FE | FlowFormPageHeader built-in Save button + sticky-footer "Save as Draft" / "Save & Publish" are intentionally duplicated to match mockup's 2-step workflow — header's generic "Save Changes" aliases "Save as Draft" in edit mode | OPEN |
| ISSUE-25 | Session 1 2026-04-21 (QA fix) | LOW | FE | Dashboard GQL milestone fields were `milestoneId`/`name` in initial FE gen but BE projects `campaignMilestoneId`/`milestoneName`. Testing Agent patched CampaignQuery.ts + CampaignDto.ts + milestone-tracker.tsx | RESOLVED |
| ISSUE-26 | Session 1 2026-04-21 (QA fix) | LOW | BE | `RaisedAmount` was missing from `CampaignResponseDto` (only on `CampaignListDto`); FE query requested it via both `getCampaigns` and `getCampaignById`. Testing Agent added `public decimal? RaisedAmount` to CampaignResponseDto | RESOLVED |
| ISSUE-27 | Session 1 2026-04-21 (QA fix) | LOW | FE | `shared-cell-renderers/index.ts` had 4 pre-existing duplicate exports (ContactsShareBar/ModifiedByCell/NameWithIcon/PrefIcon) causing TS2300 — Testing Agent removed duplicates | RESOLVED |
| ISSUE-28 | Session 1 2026-04-21 | LOW | Seed | `campaign-name-link` GridComponentName in grid seed ORDER 1 is not registered in any of 3 component-column switches. Cell renders as plain text (row-level click still works via action buttons). Fix: register a text-link/navigate renderer or use existing generic cell | OPEN |
| ISSUE-29 | Session 1 2026-04-21 | LOW | Seed | CAMPAIGNCATEGORY/CAMPAIGNSTATUS DataSetting stored as raw scalar strings (emoji / hex) rather than JSON `{"icon":"..."}` format used by AuctionManagement. Works correctly at runtime because BE projects flat scalars (`campaignCategoryIcon`, `campaignStatusColorHex`). Inconsistent with JSON convention for future tooling | OPEN |

<!-- Each session appends one entry below. Oldest first, newest last. DO NOT edit prior entries. -->

### Session 1 — 2026-04-21 — BUILD — COMPLETED

- **Scope**: Initial full build from PROMPT_READY prompt (planned 2026-04-20). ALIGN scope with near-greenfield FE rebuild. FLOW + complexity=High. Parallel Opus BE + Opus FE agents per ChequeDonation #6 / RecurringDonationSchedule #8 precedent (BA/Solution Resolver/UX Architect agents SKIPPED — prompt §①–⑫ deep + fresh; Testing Agent ran on Sonnet).
- **Files touched**:
  - BE (34 = 22 created + 12 modified):
    - CREATED: 7 child entities (CampaignDonationPurpose/ImpactMetric/Milestone/SuggestedAmount/TeamMember/TrackingMetric/RecurringFrequency) + 7 EF configs + 7 workflow commands (Duplicate/Publish/Pause/Resume/Complete/Cancel/Archive) + GetCampaignSummary + GetCampaignDashboard + migration `20260421134444_Campaign_AlignWithMockup.cs` + DB seed `sql-scripts-dyanmic/Campaign-sqlscripts.sql`
    - MODIFIED: Campaign.cs (+19 fields +7 nav collections), MasterData.cs (Compaign*→Campaign* typo fix + new CampaignTaxCategories nav), Currency.cs (Compaigns→Campaigns), CampaignConfiguration.cs (drop broken index, 3 filtered unique indexes, new FK constraints), CampaignSchemas.cs (empty stub removed, +List/Summary/Dashboard DTOs, +7 child DTOs, +RaisedAmount on ResponseDto via QA fix), CreateCampaign.cs (auto-gen code, child persist, HttpContext CompanyId), UpdateCampaign.cs (7 Sync* methods diff-persist), DeleteCampaign.cs (in-use check placeholder), GetCampaign.cs (ISSUE-3 fix + filter params + richer search), GetCampaignById.cs (all child includes), ContactMappings.cs (ISSUE-15 cleanup + scalar projections + child DTO maps), CampaignMutations.cs (+7 workflow mutations), CampaignQueries.cs (+filter args +Summary +Dashboard), IContactDbContext.cs (7 new DbSets), ContactDbContext.cs (7 new DbSet getters)
  - FE (38 = 29 created + 9 modified; 2 neutralized):
    - CREATED: 3 renderers (campaign-progress-bar / category-emoji-badge / campaign-status-badge in `data-tables/shared-cell-renderers/`) + campaign-router.tsx + index.tsx (thin re-export) + index-page.tsx (Variant B) + view-page.tsx (dispatcher) + campaign-form-page.tsx + campaign-detail-page.tsx + campaign-store.ts + campaign-widgets.tsx + campaign-filter-chip-bar.tsx + campaign-filter-bar.tsx + 4 form-tabs (basic-info/story-content/goals-tracking/settings) + 10 form-widgets (visibility-card-selector/linked-purposes-multi-select/impact-metrics-grid/milestones-grid/suggested-amounts-input/tracking-metrics-checkboxes/recurring-frequencies-checkboxes/campaign-team-multi-select/social-preview-card/image-upload-field SERVICE_PLACEHOLDER) + 9 detail components (goal-progress-hero/campaign-dashboard-kpi-strip/daily-collection-bar-chart/donor-breakdown-donut/by-orgunit-breakdown-table/by-payment-method-breakdown-table/milestone-tracker/recent-donations-feed/top-donors-leaderboard)
    - MODIFIED: CampaignDto.ts (+Request/Response extensions +7 child DTOs +ListDto +SummaryDto +DashboardDto +milestone field rename via QA), CampaignQuery.ts (+CAMPAIGN_SUMMARY_QUERY +CAMPAIGN_DASHBOARD_QUERY +extended BY_ID; milestone fields renamed via QA), CampaignMutation.ts (+7 transition mutations + extended Create/Update with children), page config campaign.tsx (CampaignDataTable→CampaignRouter), campaign/index.ts barrel (new exports), shared-cell-renderers/index.ts (+3 Campaign exports; QA removed 4 pre-existing duplicate exports), 3 component-column registries (advanced/basic/flow — imports + 3 switch cases each), milestone-tracker.tsx (campaignMilestoneId/milestoneName field rename via QA)
    - NEUTRALIZED (sandbox blocked physical deletion — requires `git rm` outside): `campaign/data-table.tsx` (tombstone `export {};`), `[lang]/organization/organizationsetup/campaign/page.tsx` (redirect stub → `/{lang}/crm/organization/campaign`)
  - DB: `sql-scripts-dyanmic/Campaign-sqlscripts.sql` (modified — menu upsert CRM_ORGANIZATION/OrderBy=2, Grid FLOW, 11 GridFields with GridComponentName values all resolving in FE registries except `campaign-name-link` per ISSUE-28, GridFormSchema=NULL, 6 MasterDataTypes CAMPAIGNCATEGORY×6/CAMPAIGNSTATUS×5 w/ ColorHex/CAMPAIGNTYPE×4/CAMPAIGNTAXCATEGORY×4/CAMPAIGNTRACKINGMETRIC×7/RECURRINGFREQUENCY, idempotent WHERE NOT EXISTS guards, BUSINESSADMIN caps, preserves `dyanmic` typo per ISSUE-13)
- **Deviations from spec**:
  - `campaignOwnerStaffId` field carried on DTOs but not surfaced as a UI form field (mockup doesn't include an Owner picker — see ISSUE-23)
  - Physical file deletion blocked by sandbox — 2 files neutralized in-place instead of deleted (see ISSUE-19)
  - `Owner picker`, Cancellation Reason dedicated column, in-use-delete check FK-scan — all deferred (out of prompt scope)
  - Grid row-click destination wiring: `decideRowClickMode(statusCode)` helper exists in store but FlowDataTable onRowClick binding deferred (see ISSUE-20)
- **Known issues opened**: ISSUE-19, ISSUE-20, ISSUE-21, ISSUE-22, ISSUE-23, ISSUE-24, ISSUE-28, ISSUE-29 (all LOW)
- **Known issues closed**: ISSUE-1 (schema), ISSUE-2 (broken index), ISSUE-3 (ApplyGridFeatures), ISSUE-4 (Compaign typo in source code), ISSUE-5 (Cancel reason param), ISSUE-9 (TipTap reused), ISSUE-12 (ApexCharts), ISSUE-13 (dyanmic typo preserved), ISSUE-14 (data-table stub neutralized), ISSUE-15 (empty stub cleanup), ISSUE-18 (milestone StatusCode live-computed), ISSUE-25, ISSUE-26, ISSUE-27 (all QA-fix resolved)
- **Testing Agent fixes** (Sonnet, run post-BE+FE): 3 blocking issues patched:
  1. Dashboard GQL milestone fields renamed (`milestoneId`→`campaignMilestoneId`, `name`→`milestoneName`) in CampaignQuery.ts + CampaignDto.ts + milestone-tracker.tsx
  2. Added `RaisedAmount` field to `CampaignResponseDto` (FE queries requested it via getCampaigns + getCampaignById)
  3. Removed 4 duplicate exports from shared-cell-renderers/index.ts (TS2300 blockers — pre-existing but unblocked by Campaign work)
- **Build verification**:
  - `dotnet build Base.Application` — 0 errors
  - `dotnet build Base.API` — 0 errors
  - `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — 0 new Campaign errors (12 pre-existing errors in other screens remain, unrelated)
  - Variant B verified: `<ScreenHeader>` @ index-page.tsx line 158 + `<FlowDataTableContainer showHeader={false}>` @ line 184
  - Renderer registration: 9/9 (3 renderers × 3 column-type registries) all resolve
  - UI uniformity 5-check grep: 0 inline hex (except data-driven status/progress + library-required ApexCharts hex), 0 inline px (except computed progress widths), 0 raw "Loading...", 0 non-Phosphor iconify, 0 `className="card"`
- **Next step**: (empty — COMPLETED). User action required:
  1. Delete `20260421134444_Campaign_AlignWithMockup.cs` and run `dotnet ef migrations add Campaign_AlignWithMockup --project Base.Infrastructure --startup-project Base.API` to regenerate .Designer.cs + clean snapshot (ISSUE-19 — team-handles-migrations rule)
  2. `dotnet ef database update`
  3. Apply `sql-scripts-dyanmic/Campaign-sqlscripts.sql`
  4. `git rm` the 2 neutralized FE files (ISSUE-19)
  5. `dotnet build` — verify 0 errors
  6. `pnpm dev` — verify page loads at `/[lang]/crm/organization/campaign`
  7. Full E2E per §⑪ (grid + 4 KPI widgets + 6 chips + form 4 tabs + detail 8 sections + 7 workflow actions)
